# Bump manifest.json version on every change

When modifying `manifest.json`, **always increment the `version` field**.

The Chrome Web Store rejects uploads where the version is not strictly greater than the currently published version. Forgetting to bump causes: "Invalid version number in manifest" upload errors.

Use semantic patch bumps (e.g. `1.1.1` → `1.1.2`) unless the change warrants a minor/major bump.
